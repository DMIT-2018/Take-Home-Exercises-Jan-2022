IMPORTANT testing for GroceryList

The data file I supplied for the GroceryList testing called NonPickedGroceryData.sql
is an older version. I have updated the file to match this semester OrderList table.

I have placed the correct file on the moodle site under Exercises/CQRS OLPT. Download it!

The file has 3 orders
 order id  133 has 8 details, store is 3, picker can be 4 (Margreet Park) or 5 (Steve Johnson)
 order id  134 has 8 details, store is 2, picker can be 3 (Jane Peacock)
 order id  135 has 5 details, store is 3, picker can be 4 (Margreet Park) or 5 (Steve Johnson)
